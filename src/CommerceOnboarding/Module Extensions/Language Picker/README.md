# Language Picker - Overview
Language picker module can be used to configure and support different languages for a multilinguel websites.A language-picker module can be added anywhere in the header or footer of the site from where a user can pick a language and get redirected to the page for that locale.

Language picker supports two views that can be configured based on the need.
1. Toggle View: In case if the site supports only two locales. It works as a switch between the two.
2. dropdown view: If the site supports more than two locales where the user can select the locale from the dropdown.

 Apart from that, there are other settings that can be configured from CMS based on the requirement like (static url redirection, persistant url etc.). Please refer documentation for setting up the appropriate view and other cms configurations.
