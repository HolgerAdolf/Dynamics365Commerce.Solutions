# Media Gallery Extension - Overview
Media gallery module supports only product images to display on product description page (PDP) at present.
The objective is to leverage the existing media gallery module to support both images and videos through view extensions.
There are two different samples for Media gallery. In this sample, we have static videos which are retrieved from CMS but the other sample is dynamic module in which we retrieve videos by calling API.
